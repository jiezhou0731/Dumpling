Product Summary
The CY7C1470V33-167AXI is a 3.3V 72-Mbit Synchronous pipelined burst SRAM with No Bus Latency (NoBL) logic, respectively. The CY7C1470V33-167AXI is designed to support unlimited true back-to-back Read/Write operations with no wait states. The CY7C1470V33-167AXI is equipped with the advanced (NoBL) logic required to enable consecutive Read/Write operations with data being transferred on every clock cycle. This feature dramatically improves the throughput of data in systems that require frequent Write/Read transitions. The CY7C1470V33-167AXI is pin compatible and functionally equivalent to ZBT device.
